## Implementation Priority

These features should be implemented in the following order as schools mature:

1. **06-attendance.sql** - When basic tracking becomes insufficient
2. **05-academic.sql** - When formal academic structure is needed
3. **17-data.sql** - When ready for advanced lead scoring (requires 04-leads.sql)
4. **16-functions.sql** - When automation and advanced triggers are needed
5. **15-views.sql** - When advanced reporting and analytics are needed
6. **07-grades.sql** - When schools need formal academic tracking
7. **13-communication.sql** - When basic communication needs expansion
8. **10-financial.sql** - When ready for automated billing
9. **12-automation.sql** - When scaling operations
10. **09-quality.sql** - When implementing quality programs
11. **14-audit.sql** - When compliance requirements increase

## Current Essential Features

The main database folder contains only the minimal tables needed for a coach to start their first school:
- **Core Infrastructure**: Organizations and user management
- **Lead Management**: Basic lead tracking (without complex scoring/funnels)
- **Basic Operations**: Coaches and facilities
- **Security & Utilities**: Core functions and permissions

## Why These Are "Future" Features

**For a coach just starting out:**
- They might track attendance on paper or simple spreadsheets
- Academic structure can start informal (no need for formal courses/enrollments)
- Complex scheduling and booking systems aren't needed initially
- Lead scoring and multi-stage funnels are marketing sophistication for later
- Focus should be on getting students, not managing complex academic systems
