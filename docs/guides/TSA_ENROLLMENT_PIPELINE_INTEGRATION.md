# TSA Enrollment Pipeline Integration

## Overview ‚úÖ

The Texas Sports Academy enrollment process has been **correctly integrated** with EdFi/OneRoster compliance data collection at the appropriate stage in the pipeline.

## TSA Enrollment Process Flow üéØ

### 1. **Interest Form** (Entry Point)
- Parents submit basic interest form
- Collects: Name, contact info, sport interest, basic student details
- **Result**: Dashboard access granted

### 2. **Dashboard Access** 
- Parents get access to comprehensive parent portal
- Can view enrollment pipeline status
- Access to scheduling, communication, documents

### 3. **Phone Consultation**
- Schedule call with coaching staff
- Discuss student goals, TSA programs
- Initial fit assessment

### 4. **Campus Tour**
- Visit TSA facilities
- Meet coaches and staff  
- See training environment

### 5. **Shadow Day Experience**
- Student participates in full day of activities
- Experience TSA culture and training
- Interaction with current students

### 6. **NWEA MAP Test**
- Academic assessment for placement
- Determines readiness level
- Used for program recommendations

### 7. **Coach Decision** (Critical Gate)
- Coach reviews all previous steps
- Makes enrollment approval/rejection decision
- **THIS IS THE KEY DECISION POINT**

### 8. **Enrollment Completion** (EdFi Form Triggered)
- **ONLY IF APPROVED**: Comprehensive EdFi form appears
- Collects all federal reporting demographics
- Creates official student records
- **Student is officially enrolled**

## Integration Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Components Created

#### 1. `EnrollmentPipeline.tsx`
```typescript
// Shows complete 8-step TSA enrollment process
// Tracks current step and status
// Integrates scheduling actions for each step
// Triggers EdFi form ONLY after coach approval

<EnrollmentPipeline
  enrollmentId="TSA-ENROLL-20240101-ABC123"
  currentStepId="phone_consultation" 
  studentName="Emma Johnson"
  coachName="Sarah Williams"
  isApproved={false}
/>
```

#### 2. `ComprehensiveEnrollmentForm.tsx` (Updated)
```typescript
// 6-step EdFi/OneRoster compliant form
// Only shown AFTER coach approval
// Collects all federal reporting demographics
// Creates official student records

// Sections:
// 1. Student Demographics (basic + generation suffix)
// 2. Birth & Immigration (EdFi compliance fields)
// 3. Ethnicity & Race (federal reporting)
// 4. Parent/Guardian (OneRoster user data)
// 5. Academic History (previous schools, special needs)
// 6. Medical Information (health records)
```

### Data Flow

    A[Interest Form] --> B[Dashboard Access]

    C --> D[Campus Tour]
    D --> E[Shadow Day]
    E --> F[NWEA MAP Test]

    H -->|No| J[Application Denied]
    I --> K[Official Student Records]
    K --> L[Enrollment Complete]
```

## Smart EdFi Integration üß†

### **Why This Approach is Correct**

1. **No Wasted Effort**: Parents don't fill out comprehensive forms until they're actually accepted
2. **Better Conversion**: Simpler initial process reduces abandonment
3. **Compliance Only When Needed**: EdFi data collected only for students who will actually enroll
4. **Coach Screening**: Ensures only suitable students go through full enrollment
5. **Federal Reporting Ready**: All approved students have complete compliance data

### **Wrong Approach** ‚ùå
```
Interest Form ‚Üí Full EdFi Form ‚Üí Assessment ‚Üí Coach Decision
```
*Problems: High abandonment, wasted effort, collecting sensitive data unnecessarily*

### **Correct Approach** ‚úÖ  
```
Interest Form ‚Üí Assessment Pipeline ‚Üí Coach Approval ‚Üí EdFi Form ‚Üí Enrollment
```
*Benefits: Higher conversion, streamlined process, compliance at right time*

## Implementation Details

### 1. Parent Portal Dashboard Integration

The `EnrollmentPipeline` component is now the main content in the parent dashboard:

```typescript
// In /app/(parents)/page.tsx
<EnrollmentPipeline
  enrollmentId="TSA-ENROLL-20240101-ABC123"
  currentStepId="phone_consultation" // Dynamic from API
  studentName="Emma Johnson"         // From enrollment data  
  coachName="Sarah Williams"         // From coach assignment
  isApproved={false}                 // From coach decision
/>
```

### 2. Step-Specific Actions

Each step has appropriate action buttons:

```typescript
// Phone Consultation
<Button onClick={() => window.location.href = '/schedule?type=consultation'}>
  Schedule Phone Consultation
</Button>

// Campus Tour  
<Button onClick={() => window.location.href = '/schedule?type=tour'}>
  Schedule Campus Tour
</Button>

// Shadow Day
<Button onClick={() => window.location.href = '/schedule?type=shadow-day'}>
  Schedule Shadow Day
</Button>

// NWEA Assessment
<Button onClick={() => window.location.href = '/assessment/nwea'}>
  Take NWEA MAP Test
</Button>

// EdFi Form (ONLY if approved)
{isApproved && currentStepId === 'enrollment_completion' && (
  <Button onClick={() => setShowEnrollmentForm(true)}>
    Complete Comprehensive Enrollment
  </Button>
)}
```

### 3. Status-Based UI

```typescript
// Different states based on coach decision
{isApproved && (
  <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-6">
    <h4>Congratulations! Enrollment Approved</h4>
    <p>Complete the final enrollment form to officially join TSA.</p>
  </div>
)}

{currentStepId === 'coach_decision' && !isApproved && (
  <div className="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-6">
    <h4>Under Review</h4>
    <p>Coach is reviewing the application...</p>
  </div>
)}
```

## Backend Integration Points

### 1. Enrollment Status API
```python
# GET /admissions/enrollments/{enrollment_id}/status
{
  "enrollment_id": "TSA-ENROLL-20240101-ABC123",
  "current_step_id": "phone_consultation",
  "student_name": "Emma Johnson",
  "coach_name": "Sarah Williams", 
  "is_approved": false,
  "completed_steps": ["interest", "dashboard_access"],
  "next_action": "Schedule phone consultation"
}
```

### 2. Coach Decision API
```python
# POST /coach/enrollments/{enrollment_id}/decision
{
  "decision": "approved|rejected",
  "notes": "Student shows excellent potential...",
  "recommended_program": "full_time"
}
```

### 3. EdFi Form Submission
```python
# POST /admissions/enrollments/{enrollment_id}/complete
{
  "student_demographics": { /* EdFi data */ },
  "parent_guardian": { /* OneRoster data */ },
  "academic_history": { /* School records */ },
  "medical_information": { /* Health data */ }
}
```

## Database Impact

### Updated Step 4 Validation
```python
# In shared_utils/shared_utils.py
def validate_enrollment_step(step_data: Dict[str, Any], step_number: int):
    if step_number == 4:  # Now the EdFi completion step
        # Require ALL EdFi demographic fields
        required_student_fields = [
            'first_name', 'last_name', 'birth_date', 'grade_level',
            'birth_sex_descriptor', 'hispanic_latino_ethnicity', 'races',
            'birth_city', 'birth_state_abbreviation_descriptor'
        ]
        # Full validation for comprehensive enrollment
```

### Student Record Creation
```python
# In lambda_parent_enrollment/student_creation.py
# Triggered ONLY after step 4 (EdFi form) completion
# Now has access to complete demographic data:
{
    'student_unique_id': generate_student_unique_id(enrollment_data),
    'student_usi': generate_student_usi(),
    'first_name': student_info.get('first_name'),
    'last_name': student_info.get('last_name'),
    'middle_name': student_info.get('middle_name'),
    'generation_code_suffix': student_info.get('generation_code_suffix'),
    'birth_date': parse_birth_date(student_info.get('birth_date')),
    'birth_city': student_info.get('birth_city'),              # ‚úÖ Now available
    'birth_state_abbreviation_descriptor': student_info.get('birth_state_abbreviation_descriptor'), # ‚úÖ Now available
    'birth_country_descriptor': student_info.get('birth_country_descriptor'), # ‚úÖ Now available
    'birth_sex_descriptor': student_info.get('birth_sex_descriptor'), # ‚úÖ Now available
    'multiplebirth_status': student_info.get('multiplebirth_status'), # ‚úÖ Now available
    'date_entered_us': parse_date(student_info.get('date_entered_us')), # ‚úÖ Now available
    'hispanic_latino_ethnicity': student_info.get('hispanic_latino_ethnicity'), # ‚úÖ Now available
    'races': format_race_data(student_info.get('races', [])), # ‚úÖ Now available
    # ... all other EdFi fields now populated
}
```
